I guarantee, that this will be the best motivational video that you will see today, It‚Äôs not like the ‚ÄúFake‚Äù motivational videos out there on YouTube. It‚Äôs literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit.We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it‚Äôs not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it‚Äôs something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option.",
